Its for listeners who love bass so if u love bass in every type of music then this is just perfect. For Ghazals, ballads, country music etc this wouldnt be a perfect choice. This has a very effective 3D surrond stage and sound s superb for Rock, lounge, EDM, Rave and Trance. I wanted all rounder and expected this to do the job but after hearing i told myself will keep for the music its made for. Well done V Moda and Ferrari Video for getting this to us for a very decent price. Am sure these will get better after few weeks of burnin.",

It seems to work only in AF-C mode and not the single shutter mode. Very useful to get tack sharp focus on eyes using fast primes wide open.Apart from photography I discovered it is really amazing for videography as well. You can get 30p 4k. Wish it was 60p for slight slo mo stuff. But you can get that in full HD. Image stabilization is great for photography. For videos with camera movements you need a gimbal or something like that.",

The battery is currently lasting me 24 hours instead of 18 hours on my Android. I’d say the 3200mAh from Apple is comparable to a 5500mAh Android battery. The 48MP camera is sharp and fast. The dynamic island is extremely helpful in many situations that involve multitasking. I use it very frequently during calls. The screen is bright and looks very clear even in direct sunlight. Haptics are very unique and delightful. Face id is much easier than a fingerprint scanner. Gone are the days of wiping your fingers. The Safari password manager can save passwords for all sites and authenticate directly with Face Id. The size of the phone 6.1 inch is very comfortable for one hand use and one needn’t shuffle around the phone for one hand use like on 6.7 inch phones.Where Apple really shines is with the ecosystem.

Attaching the unboxing video - the charger adapter is huge and cable is thicker than before. The camera is just fine nothing too exciting about it. Would comment once I use more. The cover provided by one plus isn't transparent this time primarily cos the back panel of the phone is Matt and not metallic shiny like before.",
